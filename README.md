# Introduction to Data Science 2018
Skoltech Course
MA03111 (Term 1B, 2018-2019)

## About
The course gives an introduction to the main topics of modern data analysis such as classification, regression, clustering, dimensionality reduction, reinforcement and sequence learning, scalable algorithms. Each topic is accompanied by a survey of key machine learning algorithms solving the problem and is illustrated with a set of real-world examples. The primary objective of the course is giving a broad overview of major machine learning techniques. Particular attention is paid to the modern data analysis libraries which allow solving efficiently the problems mentioned above.
